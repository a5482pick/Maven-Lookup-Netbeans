**_Selection, Lookups and Maven with Netbeans._**

Two independent window components are created in Netbeans.  'HistoryTopComponent' is able to listen for String submissions in 'TextTopComponent' using 'Lookups.'  The Lookup mechanism means HistoryTopComponent need know nothing about how TextTopComponent generates String instances: HistoryTopComponent is able to locate the instances irrespective of who or what generated them. &nbsp; String instances are submitted from TextTopComponent (using method associateLookup of class TopComponent) to its own Lookup using a) the click of a button, and also b) by clicking in turn inside each of the two text boxes. &nbsp; The crucial method in HistoryTopComponent is Utilities.actionGlobalContext().  This method, used in conjunction with a listener, observes the Lookup of whatever component currently has focus i.e. it watches the Lookup of TextTopComponent when TextTopComponent is in use.

The example: https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-maven-quickstart.html was used as a starting point.
